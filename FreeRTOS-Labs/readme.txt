*** IMPORTANT NOTE ***

FreeRTOS-Labs contains libraries and demos that are fully functional, but
undergoing optimizations or refactoring to improve memory usage, modularity,
documentation, demo usability, or test coverage.  At this time the projects ARE
A WORK IN PROGRESS and will be released in the main FreeRTOS directories of the
download following full review and completion of the documentation.

Please note, the FreeRTOS IoT libraries (MQTT, HTTPS, AWS IoT Device Shadow, 
and AWS IoT Jobs have been moved to a different location.  They can be found 
at https://github.com/freertos/freertos/tree/lts-development.

*** INTRODUCTION ***

This distribution currently contains demos from the FreeRTOS Plus Posix 
and FreeRTOS Plus FAT libraries.

The pre-configured projects use the FreeRTOS kernel Windows port (often
called the Windows simulator) to enable their evaluation using the free Visual
Studio tools and without needing specific microcontroller hardware.
