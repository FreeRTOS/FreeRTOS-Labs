/*
 * Proof of Concept for use of MQTT light weight serializer API.
 * Light weight serializer API lets user to serialize and
 * deserialize MQTT messages into user provided buffer.
 * This API allows use of statically allocated buffer.
 *
 * Example shown below uses this API to create MQTT messages and
 * and send them over connection established using FreeRTOS sockets.
 * The example is single threaded and uses statically allocated memory.
 *
 * !!! NOTE !!!
 * This is work in progress to show how light weight serializer
 * API can be used. This is not a complete demo, and should not
 * be treated as production ready code.
