/*
 * This file, along with DemoIPTrace.h, provides a basic example use of the
 * FreeRTOS+TCP trace macros.  The statistics gathered here can be viewed in
 * the command line interface.
 * See http://www.FreeRTOS.org/FreeRTOS-Plus/FreeRTOS_Plus_TCP/UDP_CLI.html
 *
 * A simple generic mechanism is used that allocates a structure (see the
 * ExampleDebugStatEntry_t definition in DemoIPTrace.h) to each ID defined in
 * the same header file.  The structures are stored in an array (see the
 * xIPTraceValues[] below.
 *
 * The structure associates a function with a data value.  See the
 * vPerformAction and ulData members of ExampleDebugStatEntry_t respectively.
 * The function is used to manipulate the data.  At the time of writing two
 * functions can be used - these are prvIncrementEventCount() which simply
 * increments the data each time it is called, and prvStoreLowest() which
 * sets the data to the lowest value of an input parameter ever seen.  For
 * example, to store the lowest ever number of free network buffer descriptors
 * the parameter value is the current number of network buffer descriptors.
 *
 * The trace macros themselves are defined in DemoIPTrace.h and just invoke
 * vExampleDebugStatUpdate(), passing in an ID value.  vExampleDebugStatUpdate()
 * then just executes the function associated with that value (prvStoreLowest(),
 * prvIncrementEventCount(), etc.) as defined in the xIPTraceValues[] array.
