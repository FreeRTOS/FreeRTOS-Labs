*** INTRODUCTION ***

The pre-configured projects use the FreeRTOS kernel Windows port (often
called the Windows simulator) to enable their evaluation using the free Visual
Studio tools and without needing specific microcontroller hardware.

NOTE: At this time the projects ARE A WORK IN PROGRESS and will be released in
the main FreeRTOS kernel download following full review and completion of the
documentation.
